                    <p> In this book, Murphy contemplates a theory that the subconscious 
                        mind has a powerful effect on everything we do and experience. 
                        He says that, if we as an individual can believe in something 
                        and visualize it clearly, we can remove all the mental blocks 
                        to achieve the desired results. He concludes that we can bring 
                        a thought to reality by wholly and truly believing in it. And, 
                        he illustrates various activities to explore the power of your

                    <p> The book begins as we leave Earth, encountering new truths 
                        about our planet‚Äôs atmosphere, the nature of sunlight, and the 
                        many missions that have demystified our galactic neighbors. But the farther 
                        out we travel, the weirder things get. What‚Äôs a void and what‚Äôs a vacuum? 
                        How can light be a wave and a particle at the same time? When we finally 
                        arrive in the blackness of outer space, Tyson takes on the spookiest 
                        phenomena of the cosmos: parallel worlds, black holes, time travel, and more.

                        often ponder, To Infinity and Beyond is an enlightening adventure into

                    <h3>Poetry</h3>
                    <p> Poetry has been around for almost four thousand years. Like other forms of 
                        literature, poetry is written to share ideas, express emotions, and create 
                        imagery. Poets choose words for their meaning and acoustics, arranging 
                        them to create a tempo known as the meter. Some poems incorporate 
                        rhyme schemes, with two or more lines that end in like-sounding words.
                        Today, poetry remains an important part of art and culture. 
                        Every year, the United States Library of Congress appoints a Poet Laureate 
                        to represent the art of poetry in America. From Shakespearean sonnets to 
                        Maya Angelou‚Äôs reflective compositions, poems are long-lived, read and 
                        recited for generations.</p>

                    <h3>Self-Help and Motivational Books</h3>
                    <p> Self-help books are all about change. A change of habits, character 
                        traits, or your physical appearance ‚Äì you name it. The thing is, 
                        you have to make the change yourself.Every New Year‚Äôs Eve, you commit 
                        to another version of ‚Äúnew year, new me.‚Äù But how does it look a few 
                        months later? Has it ever happened to you that you ended up resolving 
                        to make the same changes again the next year? Two years, three years, 
                        four years in a row? Inevitably, we‚Äôll ask ourselves: 
                        How many times do I have to try this to succeed?</p>
